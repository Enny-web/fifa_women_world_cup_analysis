This is the submission for the FIFA women analysis datathon hosted by the  Women in Data community (WIDA) from March to April, 2023. This was a team project and I had a second partner on this project. 
While she worked on building the dashboards, I worked on the data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis. This entry took us to the top 5 in the competition.
